Big Book of C Notes:

Introduction:

- C is a general purpose language, closely associated with the UNIX
system, where both the system and most of the programs for the system
run on C.

- The language is not tied to one OS however, it is not just useful for
writing OS'es and compilers, but also for major and minor programs

- Many important ideas of C extend from the language BCPL, its influence
coming from the language B, the precursor to C

- BCPL and B are 'typeless' languages, whereas C has types(int, short,
long, etc.) along with derived data types created by pointers, arrays,
structures and unions
