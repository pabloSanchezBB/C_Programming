Notes on Arduino Programming in C:

- Arduino's code is just simplified C/C++
	- The task at hand is just finding the functions and commands to add to a program
		to make it run on the arduino, once the build environment is set up, writing
		drivers should be easy
		
		
		
- Project Ideas:
	- 1. Sensors
		a. Make an LED Blink
		b. Make that LED blink from a button input
		c. Configure a sensor to take in data, have it print to this computer's terminal
		d. Configure that sensor to make the LED blink for a specific range of values
